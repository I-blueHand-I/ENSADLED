# Pixel war 

This is a project forked on Codiscovery/pixel_love repo based on the reddit game by Josh Warddle : r/place. This is code changes the pixel war gameplay to manage a game for less users and less pixels. The main changes are the colorPicker instead of the colors pre selected and a cooldown per pixel instead of a timer per users like in the reddit's r/place.
